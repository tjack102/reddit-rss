The TV Signal is an agentic workflow system that uses Antigravity (manager) and Claude Code CLI (workers) to automatically extract Reddit's /r/television RSS feed daily at 11 PM EST, filter for high-engagement discussion threads (>50 comments, Discussion/Review flairs, excluding promotional noise like trailers/casting), optionally fetch top comments via an MCP server, and generate a mobile-responsive HTML digest delivered in under 3 minutes. The system implements a 7-task pipeline (fetch RSS → parse → deduplicate against 200 seen IDs → filter → extract comments with graceful degradation → render HTML → update project memory in CLAUDE.md) with comprehensive error handling that produces fallback digests when critical tasks fail, ensuring users always receive a file. Designed as both an immediate utility for media professionals and a replicable template for lead-gen monitoring in profitable verticals (legal, finance, real estate), the project targets $900 MRR within 6 months through a freemium model: open-source self-hosting (Tier 1), managed email delivery at $9/month (Tier 2), and API access for B2B at $49/month (Tier 3), with kill criteria triggered if GitHub stars fall below 50 after 30 days or development exceeds 80 hours without revenue.
